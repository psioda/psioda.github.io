@article{Bower2017,
abstract = {Genomic instability is a hallmark of breast cancer, contributes to tumor heterogeneity, and influences chemotherapy resistance. Although Gap 2 and mitotic checkpoints are thought to prevent genomic instability, the role of these checkpoints in breast cancer is poorly understood. Here, we assess the Gap 2 and mitotic checkpoint functions of 24 breast cancer and immortalized mammary epithelial cell lines representing four of the six intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancer. We found that patterns of cell cycle checkpoint deregulation were associated with the intrinsic molecular subtype of breast cancer cell lines. Specifically, the luminal B and basal-like cell lines harbored two molecularly distinct Gap 2/mitosis checkpoint defects (impairment of the decatenation Gap 2 checkpoint and the spindle assembly checkpoint, respectively). All subtypes of breast cancer cell lines examined displayed aberrant DNA synthesis/Gap 2/mitosis progression and the basal-like and claudin-low cell lines exhibited increased percentages of chromatid cohesion defects. Furthermore, a decatenation Gap 2 checkpoint gene expression signature identified in the cell line panel correlated with clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients, suggesting that breast tumors may also harbor defects in decatenation Gap 2 checkpoint function. Taken together, these data imply that pharmacological targeting of signaling pathways driving these phenotypes may lead to the development of novel personalized treatment strategies for the latter two subtypes which currently lack targeted therapeutic options because of their triple negative breast cancer status.},
